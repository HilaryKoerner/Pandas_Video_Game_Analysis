# pandas_challenge

In this challenge I took a csv file of gaming data and was tasked with analyzing it and creating 7 different tables. 

1. Found the total number of unique gamers
2. Analyzed each purchase
3. Created a data frame based on gender. I removed duplicate screen names and found the total count and the percentage of players for each gender. 
4. Created a data frame based on gender and purchase analysis. I split the total of all purchases, average purchase price and total purchase value by gender. Then I found the avergage total purchase per person (removed duplicate screen names) and split by gender. 
5. I created bins based on age range and added this column to the original data frame. I then did a total count for each age range and the percent of players per age range. For this data frame I removed duplicate screen names. 
6. I used the data frame based on age range and analyzed the purchases. I split the total of all purchases, average purchase price and total purchase value by age range. Then I found the avergage total purchase per person (removed duplicate screen names) and split by age range.
7. I created a data frame based on unique screen name. This included number of purchases, average purchase price, and total purchase value for each player. 
8. To find the most popular item, I created a new data frame grouped by item ID and item name. I found the purchase count, item price, and total purchase value for each item. I sorted this by highest purchase count. 
9. To find the most profitable item, I used the same data frame grouped by item ID and item name and sorted the purchase count, item price, and total purchase value for each item by highest Total Purchase Value.
